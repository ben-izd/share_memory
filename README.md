# Shared Memory


![poster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56647066/184504837-42af271b-85a1-48a3-b30e-3f725012c919.jpg)

Easily and efficiently share rectangular double-typed data (any dimension) between [Python](https://python.org) - [Julia](https://julialang.org) - [Matlab](https://mathworks.com) - [Wolfram Language (Mathematica)](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) using shared memory. Each language somehow implements sharing data either for its subkernel or same processes but now you can share between them at a fast speed. It's backed by a library written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/).

To make your life and mine easier, all the function names are the same (snake_case) except Mathematica which does not support underline and is CamelCase. All of the them have simple logic `action_shared_memory[_property]`, like `get_shared_memory_flatten_length` in Julia,Python and Matlab which is `GetSharedMemoryFlattenLength` in Mathematica and all have the same functionality.

## Simple Example
Let's support you have a matrix in julia and you like to apply [`Numpy.sin`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sin.html) function on it then use Matlab [`mpower`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mpower.html), then in Mathematica use [`Minors`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Minors.html) to get the trace of that matrix, how would you do it? Saving in a file? use socket? Here is the steps with this library.

First we assume, you've downloaded the repository in your `C:\download` directory.

1. Julia
```Julia
# setup
include(raw"C:\download\julia\shared_memory.jl")

# shared memory file
set_shared_memory_path(raw"C:\download\example\data")

# our sample matrix
data = [1 2 3 ; 4 5 6 ; 7 8 9];

# share
set_shared_memory_data(data) 
```

2. Python
```python
import numpy
import sys

# setup
sys.path.append(r'C:\download\python')
from shared_memory import *
set_shared_memory_path(r'C:\download\example\data')

# receive
data = get_shared_memory_data()

# manipulate
new_data = numpy.sin(data);

# share
set_shared_memory_data(new_data)
```
3. Matlab
```matlab
% setup
addpath("C:\\download\\matlab");
addpath("C:\\download\\");
set_shared_memory_path("C:\\download\\example\\data")

% receive
data=get_shared_memory_data();

% manipulate
new_data=mpower(data,2);

% share
set_shared_memory_data(new_data)
```
4. Mathematica (Wolfram Language)
```wolfram
(* setup *)
SharedMemory`libraryPath ="C:\\download\\shared_memory.dll";
Get["C:\\download\\mathematica\\shared_memory.wl"];
SetSharedMemoryPath["C:\\download\\example\\data"];

(* receive *)
data = GetSharedMemoryData[];

(* manipulate *)
newData = Minors[data];

(* share *)
SetSharedMemoryData[newData];
```
## Initializations


### Matlab
[`matlab`](https://github.com/ben-izd/shared_memory/tree/main/matlab) folder contain all functions as seperate files, just include the that folder and the root (folder contains `.dll`) to path with [`addpath`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html) or other solutions to be able to use the functions..

Now use `set_shared_memory_path` function to set your shared_memory_file, a file use by other program to access the data you'll share or receive.

### Mathematica
Before loading the package, first you have to set ```SharedMemory`libraryPath``` to the library_path (in windows is `.dll` file). Then, use [`Get`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Get.html) or other functions to load the package.

### Julia
Open [`julia.jl` file](https://github.com/ben-izd/shared_memory/blob/a6dfdc00f4008959facd3b25b5e4320ada532214/julia/julia.jl#L2) and set `LIBRARY_PATH` to the shared library (in windows is `.dll` file).

### Python
You need [`Numpy`](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) installed  first.
Open [`python.py` file](https://github.com/ben-izd/shared_memory/blob/3ba51ce3fa9eae2c57cacb268b686616d222fd7d/python/python.py#L6) and set `LIBRARY_PATH` to the shared library (in windows is `.dll` file).


## How to use it
ðŸš§ Under construction

### Limitations
As of now, library supports:
- Only rectangular double-type arrays
- Setting a different dimension, should match the previous rank (if you want reshape the data and send it manuanly)
- Data stored in shared memory is column-major like Julia and Matlab but Mathematica and python (by default) are row major, sending and recieving data from Mathematica and python will apply the neccesary transformations. if you don't want there is a workaround.

### Advance features
ðŸš§ Under construction

## Notes for non-Windows users
The project was built on windows and the `dll` files is included in the repository, but if you're on other operating systems, you have to build the rust project on your platform which thanks to Rust cargo, is suprisingly easy.

### How to build the Rust
1. Install Rust on your computer
2. Make sure you have a internet connection and build the Rust project (rust folder) - You can read [Building for Release](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html#building-for-release) section.
3. Go inside target/release, use the built library.

#### Note
If you don't have Mathematica, you should comment the [`mathematica` module](https://github.com/ben-izd/shared_memory/blob/9b97dab3bbc81c122d4c966cee5ce1bf7733cf90/rust/src/lib.rs#L359) in [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/ben-izd/shared_memory/blob/main/rust/src/lib.rs) and also comment `wolfram-library-link = "0.2.5"` in [`cargo.toml`](https://github.com/ben-izd/shared_memory/blob/main/rust/Cargo.toml) file
