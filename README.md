# Shared Memory - ðŸš§ Under construction


![poster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56647066/184504837-42af271b-85a1-48a3-b30e-3f725012c919.jpg)

Easily and efficiently share rectangular double-typed data (any dimension) between [Python](https://python.org) - [Julia](https://julialang.org) - [Matlab](https://mathworks.com) - [Wolfram Language (Mathematica)](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) using shared memory. Each language somehow implements sharing data either for its subkernel or same processes but now you can share between them at a fast speed. It's backed by a library written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/).
